# PPO Discrete

## Overview

This repository contains an implementation of the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm for discrete action spaces. PPO is a reinforcement learning algorithm introduced by OpenAI to improve the training stability and performance of policy gradient methods.

For a detailed understanding of PPO, you can refer to the original research paper by Schulman et al.:
[Proximal Policy Optimization Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347).
